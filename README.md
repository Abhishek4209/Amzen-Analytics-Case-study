# **Amazen CASE STUDY**


## **Current scenario:-**
```
Amzen is leading pharmaceutical company based in U.S. There drug Enbrel is one of the most sold drug across U.S. used in rheumatoid arthritis. Amzen has been various campaigns and promotional activities in the past to support sales of their drug. One such measure was copay support for the patients; Enbrel being the branded was expensive to most of the lower/middle income group people. Amzen used to support these patients through their copay scheme, in which they used to issue a copay card which could be used by the patients for the payment purpose. These cards were managed by an external third party “IMS”. The patients with the copay scheme were benefitted with the copay support of $4000 semi annually.

```

## **Expected new scenario:-**

```
According to the US healthcare scheme, each citizen has to be assured through life/health insurance. The insurance companies provide support to the patients in their treatment. All drugs covered through such insurance companies were categorized in different tier levels based on their coverage. i.e. a top tier drug was most covered and lower tier drug was least covered.
UHC was insurance company, which used to provide support to Enbrel patients, but it is expected that starting from year 2015 the Enbrel will be lowered downed in the tier level from position two to position three, this will lead to more burden to the Enbrel patients. On the other, the Enbrel alternative drug Humria is expect to have jump in tier level. Hence, it is expected that there will be huge amount of slippage from Enbrel to Humria drug.

```
#### The situation becomes more problematic as the UHC has also declared that they will no further accept copay cards from the patients.


## **Business Challenge:**


### Amzen does not expect any new addition to their customer base due to above new scenario and they are entirely focused to retain existing customer base. They consider patient treatment status, Copay usage and adherence to therapy as crucial variable that could drive this analysis. Amzen wants to get possible answer to below mentioned problems:
```bash
1.The client wants to estimate slippage of the patients from their system.
2.Suggest possible approach to lower down the patient’s slippage, so to minimize overall loss.
3.Weekly list Potential existing customers to be targeted.
4.Design a new/alternative copay scheme, which could be better used by the patients.

```
